# <div align="center">IntroToCrypto_RSA</div>
A beginner-friendly project exploring the fundamentals of RSA encryption and decryption. Part of the CSC15005 course, this project provides an introduction to cryptographic concepts, key generation, encryption, and decryption processes using RSA, showcasing practical implementation and secure communication basics.
  
## Introduction
This project aims to provide learners with a fundamental understanding of the RSA algorithm, one of the first and widely-used public-key encryption systems to secure communications.

## Contents

- **Key Generation**: Guide on creating public and private key pairs using RSA.
- **Encryption**: How to encrypt messages using the public key.
- **Decryption**: How to decrypt messages using the private key.
- **Practice**: Examples illustrating RSA implementation in practice.

## System Requirements

- Language: C++17
- Compiler: Any C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Build System: CMake (optional, for multi-platform support)
